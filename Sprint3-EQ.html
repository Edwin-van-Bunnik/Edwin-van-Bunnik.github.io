   <h3>What is emotional Intelligence</h3>
   <div class="item">
           
             <p>Emotional Intelligence is the ability to be in tune with oneself and also being able to read situations
                from verbal and non verbal ques, such as body language / behaviour and whether people are comfortable or not.</p>
                <p>Emotional Intelligence for myself is knowing what I am doing, and controlling myself. One of my favourite sayings
                   is that ”I like to eat desert at the end”,  For instance like to reverse the car in,  so when I drive out I am driving
                    forward and appreciate the effort gone in before.  I like to do the hard work first, and enjoy the fruits of my effort later</p>
                    <p>Emotional Intelligence also encompasses identifying my own emotions and what affect they have on me and how I portray.  
                      How do I react in good and not so good situations, am I calm for instance</p>
                      <p>People who have good Emotional Intelligence skills, are those that get on well with people</p>
                      <p>I am going through a challenging time, being made redundant at the end of the year,  and I know that this
                         is stressing me, and I feel a need to get another job, but I need to make sure I go for the job that I want to do,
                          and not any job, just to tick the “I have a job” box</p>
              </div>  
    <h3>Differences with Intellectual ability</h3>
   <div class="item">           
             <p>Intellectual ability is more about being smart, and good at learning and thinking about doing tasks   
             </p>
              </div>  
      <h3>Why is it Important </h3>
      <div class="item">           
             <p>Important to understand both concepts, as we need to know why from an individuals perspective how we are achieving something and are we combing both to good at our job   
             </p>
