             <p Padding: 10px>Padding - is what creates negative space between elements within the border that they are contained,  creates space internally and this negative space is 
              not used for anything.   
            An example of Padding is a vegetable garden adjacent to a plaing area. The Vege garden is negative space when it comes to playing as you can only play on the lawn.</p>
        
            <p>Margins allow elements to be pushed away from each other, the Margin creates space outside of the border.   </p>
            
            <p>Border - is what can be created around a element,  Borders can be solid dashed and invisible. </p>

            <p> Describing Margins, Padding and Borders   An example of a border is a fence that goes around a property. 
                Inside the fence could be a vege garden which is a negative space for playing as you can only play on the grass area
                adjacent to the Vege garden.
                Outside of the fence could be a public walkway or Alleyway between two fences (fences are the borders of each Property)
