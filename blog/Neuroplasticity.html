      <h2>  Neuroplasticity  </h2>

        <p>My thinking and experience about this is that if nothing changes, nothing else is going to happen.
          And a lot of it comes up with having a positive attitude and wanting to do something.     </p>

<p>My experience in wanting to do something has had a psitive impact, its not to say all the experiences are
   positive, and there are certainly times whwere it has been desperate situations with new challenges, but I have a belief that I 
   will always get to the end goal, I will get ether somehow.
   
   By learning something new, this has been beneficial to myself, and extended ny stay at my current employer
   as I was doing a function that was deemed essential.  
   
   Back to Neuroplasticity,  practice and re-reading for me is essential, as I take in the topic the more times I visit it. 
   What I have noticed is that I have been sent on training courses about a new product/software AndI have learned more when
    I have dabbled with it first for a little while before going on the traing course, as I can 
    relate real life situations to what is being taught.  As opposed to going straight onto a course
    and not really picking up what I should be picking up.</p>
