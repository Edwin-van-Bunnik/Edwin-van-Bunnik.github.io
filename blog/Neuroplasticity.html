      <h2>  Neuroplasticity  </h2>

        <p>Understanding the principles of neuroplasticity can benefit people as it opens people up to the idea that they
           are not pigeon holed at a certain level, and that they can learn new information, but it also goes in the other
           direction, if you stop learning about a topic your knowledge on that topic wanes. In theory we evolve from babies
           and soak up detail around us as we grow and learn, but for some reason as adults or grown ups we may limit the
           knowledge we absorb, and this restricts our growing of knowledge.  Neuroplasticity is not only about knowledge
           but it can have power over our bodies to develop and heal if we have the right attitude.  By just thinking about
           exercise this stimulates the muscles in the body that would be associated to those exercises. </p>

          I find that when practicing something new, that I become better and more fluent at it. Like Javascripting now at
          Dev Academy - has awakened me and opened up those connections that were established previously. By re-connecting 
          with Javascript I enjoyed it, especially the loops, and had my plan of attack for “Dress the clown”, and that I 
          wanted to use arrays and loops to limit my code. Understanding that as I do not do a activity much anymore, I would
          lose the fluency of it.  Experienced that many times, understand now that I have to re-establish those connections 
          to become as fluent again. </p>
          
          Ways to increase my neuroplasticity are to think about activities such as exercise and that stimulates muscles in
          the body to act as though they have done the exercises.  It has made me think about how I approach my exercise routine.
          Also more importantly practise something, and this build the brain connections for specific tasks and you get better 
          at it. Also the power of thought that you can do it, building upon success.  Always remember the turning point for
          Maths for myself,  I had one of the top four marks in the class for that particular test – not a important test.
          But then I believed that I could do it,  and always did well at Maths after that.  </p>
          
          I resource I found about the brain growing was a girl aged three who had seizures, and had her right hand side of
          brain removed and the left had side of the brain grew. Shows that your brain can grow and we don’t use much of it.

    <h2>  Research Growth Mindset  </h2>
<p>Growth mindset is the concept that we can grow and improve our understanding of topics and learn.  We can solve problems,
   but I think it is where people want to do this, some people just are not interested.  One of my nieces decided that she was 
  Going to put more effort in at school, and started to excel in her subjects, and has carried this through university and has
   reaped the rewards. </p>
  
   <p>I think this is not new to me, as there are always challenges ahead of us all the time, and we need to think how we are
   going to overcome them. And when you do you are surprised by the fact that you did it, and it wasn’t that hard. </p>
  
   <p>I think I have already been using growth mindset in my learning so far,  I have been enjoying the coding, and have 
  enjoyed the challenges. </p>
  
  <p>Carol Dweck,  the power can improve to believe that you is a positive video, and gives stimulus that we can do anything
   we want to do, and can do it.  </p>


   <h2> Blend with your learning plan and strategies   </h2>
   <p>I think that doing this course has been positive, as it has re-connected me with programming and enjoyed it. I haven’t been
    phased too much when I have had a problem. What I have learned was that the more time I put into figuring out something the
    more likely it will be that I will find the answer, and can use what I have just learned for other situations. I found that 
    what I learned in the previous JS Carnival exercise I could use in the current one .  I think practice is something that I 
    will do more just to keep the scripting connections stronger.
