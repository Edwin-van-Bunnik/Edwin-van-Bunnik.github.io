        <h2>Learning Plan BootCamp</h2>

        <p> My long term Goal is web development, and that is moving away from my current IT skills, of
            programming in Javascrip, SQL and Cobol, I really enjoyed Javascript   </p> 
        
        
        <h2>What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?   </h2>
        
        <p>My strengths I have nolticed with foundations, is that I didn't let a problem go away,  I might have a break
        from it, but would re-visit it, and know that it needed to be done.  I knew that there is a answer ther somewhere
        and intrigued to find it. I am still into backup plans.
        Weaknesses, definately need to read the question a couple of times to get full gist of what is happening, and 
        read through the whole exercise before I start, as there may be more help in there than I thought.  </p>
        
        
        <h2>What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?  </h2>
        
        <p>Not sure, interesting working in a group with other people remotely   </p>
        
        
        <h2>What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy? </h2>
        
        <p>I still think I need to learn a bit of Tolerance if I am feeling impatient, and to slow down at times    </p>
        
        
        <h2>What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team? </h2>
        
        <p>Having a 1:1 session will be good, especially non-technical as that will be the most important part  </p>
        
        
        <h2>What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp   </h2>
        
        <p>Putting the time in that I need to put in to get the challenges completed    </p>
        
        




       <h2>FoundationGoals</h2>

      <p> My long term Goal is web development, and that is moving away from my current IT skills, of
programming in Javascrip, SQL and Cobol   </p> 


<h2>A description of your own strengths and limitations in relation to learning   </h2>

<p>My strengths are that I like to give myself plenty of time to do a task, what I mean is that 
if I need to have a plan B or Plan C if things don't work initially.  Weaknesses, is that I may need to reread
learning again and practise them to get a better understanding of them   </p>


<h2>What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?  </h2>

<p>I think I need to learn a bit of Tolerance if I am feeling impatient    </p>


<h2>A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include:
An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners,
 facilitators and industry/community representatives </h2>

<p>For foundations, I will ba attacking this 7 days a week, even if it means a hour on a day.  I am still employed full-time
and do have duties to fullfil    </p>

<h2>What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you   </h2>

<p>Need  to take a break and have a change of scene, so my sub conscious can work on a problem,  this would
mena a bike ride, not watching TV or other Tech    </p>


<h2>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way   </h2>

<p>If I get stuck,  I will need to see if I can work out a problem,  if not list a question on Slack.
  I did this this morning, as it needed another mind     </p>


  <h2>A description of what you expect from the facilitation team    </h2>

<p>Guidance when I get stuck, and realise that I am working fulltime, and in advance will indicate my week schedule    </p>

<h2>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things.   </h2>

<p>I have noted my one on one weekly calls, so I scheduled these during the week which I can adhere too.
My time focus for foundations, is during the day for a number of hours, and then a fewe hours each evening    </p>
