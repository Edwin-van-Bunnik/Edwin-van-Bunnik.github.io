        My long term Goal is web development, and that is moving away from my current IT skills, of
programming in Javascrip, SQL and Cobol


A description of your own strengths and limitations in relation to learning

My strengths are that I like to give myself plenty of time to do a task, what I mean is that 
if I need to have a plan B or Plan C if things don't work initially.  Weaknesses, is that I may need to reread
learning again and practise them to get a better understanding of them


What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?

I think I need to learn a bit of Tolerance if I am feeling impatient


A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include:
An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, facilitators and industry/community representatives

For foundations, I will ba attacking this 7 days a week, even if it means a hour on a day.  I am still employed full-time
and do have duties to fullfil

What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you

Need  to take a break and have a change of scene, so my sub conscious can work on a problem,  this would
mena a bike ride, not watching TV or other Tech


A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way

If I get stuck,  I will need to see if I can work out a problem,  if not list a question on Slack.  I did this this morning, as it needed another mind


A description of what you expect from the facilitation team

Guidance when I get stuck, and realise that I am working fulltime, and in advance will indicate my week schedule

Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things.

I have noted my one on one weekly calls, so I scheduled these during the week which I can adhere too.
My time focus for foundations, is during the day for a number of hours, and then a fewe hours each evening
