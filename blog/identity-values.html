        Identity Value and Strengths

Recently had to make a ethical decision regards who's place we are going to hold Christmas at.
The decision as to what to do was landed on me and to act upon it. I proceeded to go along the path of what happened in the last cycle, which would not please everyone,
but I thought it was the right decision and if some people were not happy, they were not happy 
because they did not get what they ultimately wanted.

I felt comfortable and at peace with what I did because it was correct, and the way it should have been.  I did feel uncomfortable about doing it at the time
but knowing I was doing the correct choice that made it easier to do.  If I had not of made that choice I would not have been happy myself, and would have huert other 
people who did not deserve it.

It was how I was bought up, and I showed respect

Describing my Strengths and Limitations

What I have learned recently,  is that the more I prepare in advance for something and get the groundwork done
at the correct time the rest of the project will flow much better.  This also involves getting rid of distractions that
could interfere with what I wil be doing.  Get these sorted, so I can focus on the task coming up.  Even if that means I
 don't get into the meat of the task until after lunch.  I notice that I will do a better job, and reap the rewards of
 getting some of the ground work and tedius tasks completed early.

I think for me the more prep work I doi early, and have things ready for later is my strengths.

I don't like leaving things things to the last minute where ther is no time for a plan B or plan C.
Becasue you never know what is going to happen

A example of early preperation was when I was creating a new B2B encryption for the system that I was working on,
 and I had to co-ordinate the install with 10 other Trading Partners who would be using the newly created public key.
I was nervous about it and hadn't done this before by myself.

Once I had created the encryption, and the new Public key,  I thought try it with one Trading partner first, which
I did and this worked.  So at this stage I knew I had it correct, and that I wasn't going to destroy messaging for 10 other Trading Partners.
This gave me confidence to co-ordinate deployments with the remaining 9 Trading Partners, and also if there was a problem, I knew it wasn't
mine.  There were issues later on during the installs with other Trading Partners, and they were all on their environments, which they had to rectify.
