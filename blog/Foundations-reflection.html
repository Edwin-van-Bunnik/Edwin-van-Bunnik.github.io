      <h2> Foundations Reflections  </h2>

      <h3>What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning? </h3>
      <p>  I have learned that the more I prepare for a task the better it goes, and I don't get interrupted 
           with detail that should have been sorted before I started      </p>
           <p> I had decided before the foundation course, that I would make sacrifices  and would need to to 
             complete this course, and I did make them.
     
           </p>
           <p>I wasn't sure how I would go with some of the technical aspects, but once I got going it gave me more confidence
     
           </p>



        <h3> What are the role of values, empathy, and self awareness in learning and programming?  </h3>
        <p>Values and empathy of programming and learning, are yopu committed to what you are doing, and putting in the time 
          and effort for your learnings and be able to deomonstrate what you have learned. </p>
          <p> Self Awareness - when I understand myself and know what I am good at, and how I handled situations, or not.        
  
        </p>
        <h3>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?  </h3>
        <p>What suprised me the most about core learning was that I could reflect on what I have been through
          myself with my work places and all my colleagues, and can see situations and the core learning has helped 
          explain them
  
        </p>
        <h3> What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?  </h3>
        <p>   I think some of the most challenging aspects of core learning was doing the one on ones with
              other people, who I don't know,  not much of a introduction.  I wasn't phased by the topics, 
              they were quite interesting, and relevant to the IT industry.
  
        </p>
        <h3> Why do you think that we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning 
                  in a web development bootcamp course?  </h3>  I 
                  <p>   Its said quite early on, its not about being a good coder, but in IT you have to work
                        well with other people to get the best results. I don't think there was too much time
                        spent on Core and it was relevant.
            
                  </p>
        <h3> Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just
                 used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.  </h3>
                 <p>At times you want to get stuck into coding and seeing output and results, which is tangible.
                    But the amount of time on Core was about right, and could be done as a background task on 
                    some occassions.  Also with everyone I think working remotely there is no physical sense
                    of what other people are doing, or how they work, so Core was a educator about how the IT 
                    world works.
