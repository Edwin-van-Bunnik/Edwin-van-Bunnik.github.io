   <h3>Describe the Differences between HTML and CSS</h3>
   <div class="item">
           
             <p>A way to describe what is and the relationship behind HTML and CSS is that HTML is the building, and CSS is what
                gives the building its colour. For example two buildings which are exactly the same shape.  Both buildings
                are own by different people, and the owners paint their buildings different colours, The owners are applying their own
                style  the style is the CSS file and the builkdings are the HTML.</p>
              </div>  
    <h3>Explain control flow and loops </h3>
   <div class="item">           
             <p>Control flows are the order in which tasks are done in a activity and Loops are performing a task many times over.
               An example of this is building a fence in the correct order dig holes (loop as I wil dig Three Holes) Then the
               fence posts need to go in  Loop I wil put in 3 fence posts), concrete the fence posts in (loop again), 
               Put up my horozontal railings (loop 2 times as I have two fence rails) -  control flow of holes, fence posts, concrete, railigs, 
               and breaking down the fence pailings.  Is another loop task which is repetative I will do many times until I complete 
               the length of the fence or I run ot of Pailings as I don't know how many pailings I needed. Then I have a singular task of 
               putting the fence capping on top of all the fence pailings and then the fence gets painted.   
             </p>
              </div>  
      <h3>Describe what the DOM is </h3>
      <div class="item">           
             <p>The DOM Document Object Model is something that is heden from view on a web page.
                The Dom is what is following the instructions it was given to present the webpage, it has a copy
                of the instructions. But these instructions can be edited and altered to change the appearance 
                of the webpage. Renmeber this is a copy, when the Webpage ios reladed it gets a copy of the original 
                instructions again.

                An anaology of this could be a recipe for banaane cake written in the cook book, but I make the banana cake and 
                follow the recipe, I can make changes like reducing the amount of sugar.  I bake my cake and eat it.

                Next time I get the recipe out from the cook book it still has the original instructions, and not the reduced 
                sugar instructions.

        <h3>Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects</h3>
         <div class="item">           
              <p> Objects are good for storing name and address information, and for accessing data they can be accessed via 
                a loop to sequeantially look at all the data or a index, and also a Object has many different data attributes 
                on the same storeage index  


                Arrays contain many items of the same key, and can be accessed via a index.

              </p>

          <h3>Explain what functions are and why they are useful</h3>
          <div class="item">           
               <p>Functions are a a procedure maybe with 1 to many statements that can be called by another statement.
                    A function should take some form of input and deliver a result.

                    A calculator could be viewd as a function, as you are giving it inputs like numbers and what you want
                    it to do susch as addition,  it will perform your request and eliver a result
