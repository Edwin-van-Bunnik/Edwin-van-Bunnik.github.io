             <h4>Tell your non-tech friend a story about a time you: </h4>
              <h4>1.	Got blocked on a simple problem   </h4>
              
              <p Padding: 80px>I was looking at answering a question using specific methods, and the new style of Javascripting and stumped. </p>
        
            <h4>2.	Solved a problem in an elegant way. </h4>

              <p>What I did was did a google serach on how to use the specific method, and the website gave
              an example, and it also lets you run the code and see the results. I was also able to 
              add lines of my code in the website run editor, and from this I could display out
              the contents of variable at certian lines of code.  This helped me understand what was going 
              on, and then I could make changes to the code to reflect the question   </p>
            
            <h4>In both cases:  </h4>
            <h4> •	What was the problem?  </h4>
            <h4>  •	What problem solving techniques did you use?  </h4>
            <h4> •	How did you feel throughout the process?  </h4>
            <h4> •	What did you learn?    </h4>
              <p>The problem was that I didn't understand whjat the method was, and also the new style of Javascript  </p>

              <p>How I solved the problem was by slowly going through the code, and understand wat each step did,
there were many steps on each line.  Also displaying the values of what a method does this helped me understand 
what was happening in particular the method split.  Displayed the output of a string that used split and saw that
 the string was now an array. each occurrance of the array is fed into the next function   </p>

 <p>I felt good, as I understood what was going on in the line of code,  not only
that but the next day, and looking at exercises in edabit they had a really good desciption
and used the example on a basic equation.  Having the time to research later and after a good nights sleep
helped as well </p>

<p>I learned that I need to slow down, have a break, and try and not think about the problem helps </p>

            
            

            <h4> Reflect on how confident you feel using the problem solving techniques and process: </h4>
              <ul>
              <li>	Pseudocode </li>
              <li>	Trying something </li>
              <li>	Rubber ducky method </li>
              <li>	Reading error messages </li>
              <li>	Console.logging </li>
              <li>	Googling </li>
              <li>	Asking your peers for help </li>
              <li>	Asking coaches for help </li>
              <li>	Improving your process with reflection </li>
            </ul>
             <p> I am quite confident about using the problem solving techniques,  I hadn't done Psedocode
              for a while, but was always a fan of structured diagrams and flowcharts,  which helps map
              out the process, they give a picture of what to do, but don't necessaryily reflect how
              tyou would code it. </p>
              
              <p>   Console logging is my favourite way, as I want to see what is happening to values as going through the flow of the code.
              <p>That way the area of fault can be pinpointed.  </p>
              
              <p>Googling is such a valuable tool now, as there is so many examples, and practices available  </p>
              
              <p>Also asking slack has been useful, as you know the issue is fixable  </p>
