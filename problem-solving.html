              <h4>1.	Got blocked on a simple problem   </h4>
              
              <p Padding: 80px>
                I got stopped on the unicorn exercise, where I was getting a error when I ran the code, and the error message 
                indicated the element didn't exist. I started using my favourite MO which is to display the contents of the values
                at certain points of the program combined with changing the code, to see if a difference was made.  Still encountering 
                a error.  Getting a little bit frustrated with this as couldn't understand why it was faulting.  I then put 
                in more display messages, and realised ahh my index's were wrong calling the 2nd index and not the first
                 (position 1 not position 0),  but still it was faulting.  I checked my elementId's for my files, and saw that I had
                changed the first ID of three, but not the remaining two and they were not formatted the same was as the first.
                
                What had happened was that I was focused on getting the basics of the program working with the index set to first file
                and had that named as I wanted.  Need to be consistant with changing all similar fields,  and not only that
                but to hard copy text to maintain the accurracy of names uppercase vs lowercase.  

                Had a very similar incident in Production at work where I had installed two messaging certificates, one for "Test" and
                one for  "Production" environment. Due to my Laptop crashing my colleague installed the certificates in the keystore, so 
                all I had to do was at the co-ordinated time make configuration changes using the new Certicate Alias and test them with
                the B2B Trading Partner.
                My Colleague provided me with the certificate Alias names, and "Test" environment went well, but when it came to 
                Production the install went well, some config changes are via a dropdown menu accessing alias names from the certificate
                keystore, found the certificate alias with the date on it. But one config change required my to copy the Alias name in.  
                I did this from the email I received with the alias names from my colleague.  Messages were not being exchanged, and 
                it looked like our side was at fault.
                My Colleague had a look, couldn't see what was wrong, the configs looked right. Called in more eyes to look at it and 
                we had a inconsistency of alias names       xyz_SHA2_AS2_20211021   vs xyz_AS2_SHA2_2021102. 
                Easy to fix, and being in production  not a great look, but it didn't cause serious impact.  Just not seeing what was wrong
                and not knowing why the new certificate was not being picked up in sending out messages, but working when receiving messages.
                We don't have any tools at our disposal to check what or what certificate is not being used in the message exchanges, limited 
                to getting more eyes on it, and they could see it clearly.
                Pressure situation, dealing with someone from another organisation, and persoannly you don't look good (they didn't know our
                 fault cause). We need to get it fixed quickly, and escalating through the options to fix it. Afterwards you learn to do things
                differently like  now I created the Alias names in a notepad file first, and use a copy and paste when inserting them in the 
                configuration process and the certificate keystore.   I have seen this happen many times on the other side, and I know what they
                are going through and to be patient, as they have to solve it.  I sometimes advise if certain servers have been updated, as 
                I get to know their setups

            <h4>2.	Solved a problem in an elegant way. </h4>

              <p>I was working on the Whack-a-mole Javascript, and I followed the guide of what to do, one was to create a 
                2 dimensional array, which can be used to get table co-ordinates.  I did that, it worked fine.  It wasn't a 
                 problem, but I ended up with a better way to get random table co-ordinates, and that was to run the random number 
                  generator twice, once for rows and one for columns, and this depleted a whole lot of linage out of my program.

                  How did I get to think about it, it came by taking a break, well actually going to bed, but the brain was still
                  buzzing, and that idea came to me,  I thought that was a far better solution, again just taking a step back 
                  and letting the sub conscious work it out was a great method.  

                  With the same program I had managed to display the mole on my screen, and then I went and made a number of 
                  changes and a bit of code tidy up, and it didn't work.  I thought too many changes here since it worked.
                  So I went back to the Github repository and grabbed a version that had the feature working.  I took the 
                  retrieved code, and slotted it into my exisiting program, to get the mole appearing.  That worked but didn't 
                  understand where I had gone wrong, until I figured out the creation of the dynamic element for the image had 
                  to be "img" and not what I had to changed it to.  so I learned what I had done wrong, confirmed this by doing 
                  a few test runs, and from there the rest went smoothly, and I managed to quickly solve another problem of How
                  to revert the background. I think that problem got solved by searching through the internet for solutions
                  and found a neat way of updating the dynamic image element, whereas I though I wopuld need two. But I was able 
                  to reduce the amount of code again, and when looked at the final solution saw that I had 56 lines of code
                  and that had taken me 6 hours to complete,  pleased but not pleased.  
                 
              </p>
            
            
            
            

            <h4> Reflect on how confident you feel using the problem solving techniques and process: </h4>

              <li>	Asking your peers for help </li>
              <li>	Asking coaches for help </li>
              <li>	Improving your process with reflection </li>
            </ul>
             <p> I hadn't done Psedocode  for a while, but was always a fan of structured diagrams and flowcharts,
                 which helps map out the process and steps, they give a picture of what to do and the order,
                  but don't necessaryily reflect how you would code it. With structured diagrams you can spot
                  potential problems coming up at a cheap stage of development</p>
              
              <p> Trying something,  before I rerun after a error, I make sure I have changed code as to where
                   I think the problem could be, if nothing has changed you are always going to get the same result.
                   This also helps with elimination ofwhat the problem could be </p>

              <p> Rubber Duck Method,  can't see the trees for the forest,  it has happened to me a couple of times
                in the past when talking over what has happened and the penny has dropped, and you know what has caused 
                the problem. Had the penny drop when people come and see me about their problems</p>

              <p>   Console logging is my favourite way, as I want to see what is happening to values as going through 
                the flow of the code and what is happening to them. This also shows me where in the code I might be 
                erroring.  </p>

              <p>Reading error messages,  it has come in handy,  first by giving an accurate line number,
                which has saved much effort in searching.  Sometimes the descriptions are not that great, but I know what
                code is at fault.  </p>
              
              <p>Googling is such a valuable tool now, as there is so many examples and some of the websites have practice
                arenas where you can't do any damage and you can play with the code, and it is solely focused on one area.  </p>
              
              <p>Asking slack has been useful, as you know the issue is fixable. And people have 
                a different way of looking at a issue that you may have, and this helps to look at a 
              problem differently.   </p>

              <p>Asking coaches for help, or higher up people.  It is useful as more than likely they have experienced
                the problem themselves, and have more knowledge of the environment that you are working in   </p>

                <p>Improving your process with reflection,  Taking a step back  and thinking about the issue when the 
                  environment is not stressful or hectic, you are more balanced in your thinking and probably not biased
                  due to the environment. </p>
